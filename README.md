# Nexus Motors EV Plant COGS & Cost Optimization (Case Simulation)

This repository documents a **cost modeling and analysis project** focused on **site selection and procurement optimization** for Nexus Motors' upcoming EV manufacturing plant in India. The study evaluates **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**, overhead, inventory costs, and supplier discounts to determine the most cost-effective strategy.

---

## **Project Overview**
Nexus Motors, a leading global automotive manufacturer, plans to expand into India with its EV model, *Voltaris Z*. The company needs to choose the optimal plant location among **Pune, Gurugram, and Chennai** while factoring in cost structures, production forecasts, and potential supplier cost reductions.

**Key Objectives:**
1. **Calculate COGS and overhead costs** (materials, labor, logistics, depreciation, inventory carrying cost) for all three locations.  
2. **Identify the lowest-cost location** based on a fully loaded cost model for the 2027 launch year.  
3. **Estimate procurement cost reductions** resulting from the planned acquisition of AutoAI, leveraging scale-based discounts.

---

## **Key Highlights**
- **COGS-based cost model** developed for three locations:
  - Raw materials, labor, logistics, HR & admin, S&M, inventory costs, and CAPEX depreciation.
- **Pune recommended** as the manufacturing site with the **lowest total cost: ₹43.03B**,  
  **~6% cheaper vs Chennai** and **~2% cheaper vs Gurugram**.
- **Annual cost reduction of ₹5.19B** achieved through **bulk supplier discounts**:
  - Raw materials: 10%  
  - Labor: 5%  
  - Logistics: 10%
